# Cloned Repositories

No repositories were cloned.

An attempt was made to clone the repository for the DODO paper ("DODO: Dynamic Contextual Compression for Decoder-only LMs") from the following locations:
- `https://github.com/Guanghui-Qin/DODO.git`
- `https://github.com/hiaoxui/DODO.git`

Both attempts failed as the repository was not found. It is possible that the code has not been publicly released or is in a private repository.

The paper mentions the use of the following libraries:
- `huggingface/peft`
- `PyTorch`
- `DeepSpeed`

These are well-maintained and readily available libraries.
