    "article": "(CNN)Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row for murders he says he didn't commit. And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. \"All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody,\" Hinton told reporters. \"But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.\" Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. \"Death Row Stories\": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. \"Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,\" Bryan Stevenson, the group's executive director and Hinton's lead attorney, said of his African-American client. \"I can't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.\" Stevenson said the \"refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling.\" Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent \"not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\" He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. \"For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn't have (sat) on death row for 30 years,\" he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and \"sort out what he wants to do,\" Stevenson said.",

    "dense_summary": "Anthony Ray Hinton, a 58-year-old African-American man, was released from Alabama's death row after nearly 30 years, following a wrongful conviction for two murders he insists he did not commit. Hinton was initially convicted in 1985 for the murders of two Birmingham-area fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. His conviction was primarily based on the assertion that a revolver found at his home was the murder weapon. However, a new trial was ordered in 2014 after forensic experts testified that the gun could not be conclusively linked to the crime scenes or the murders themselves.\n\nThe Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a legal advocacy organization, played a crucial role in Hinton's release. Bryan Stevenson, EJI\u2019s executive director and Hinton\u2019s lead attorney, highlighted the systemic issues of race, poverty, inadequate legal representation, and prosecutorial indifference that contributed to Hinton's wrongful conviction. Stevenson criticized the state's reluctance to re-examine the case, despite compelling evidence of Hinton's innocence, calling it a stark example of the need for reform in the capital punishment system.\n\nUpon his release, Hinton expressed gratitude for his freedom, attributing it to divine intervention and the dedication of his legal team. He lamented the loss of three decades of his life under the constant threat of execution and expressed his intention to pray for the families of the murder victims, acknowledging that they too suffered from the miscarriage of justice.\n\nJefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro ordered Hinton's release after the state motioned to dismiss the charges against him. The decision not to re-prosecute followed the 2014 ruling for a new trial, which stemmed from the inability to match the alleged murder weapon to the crimes. Hinton, who was 29 at the time of his arrest, had consistently maintained his innocence.\n\nHinton's case underscores significant flaws in the U.S. capital punishment system, as highlighted by the CNN report and the EJI. It raises questions about the reliability of forensic evidence, the impact of racial and economic biases, and the resistance of some state prosecutors to revisit potentially wrongful convictions. The case has drawn attention to the broader issues within the justice system that can lead to such grave injustices.\n\nFollowing his release, Hinton planned to spend time with family and friends while adjusting to life outside prison. His immediate priorities included obtaining identification and undergoing a health checkup. His legal team planned to assist him in navigating the initial stages of his newfound freedom and in making future plans.\n\nHinton\u2019s release has been celebrated as a victory for justice and a testament to the importance of advocacy and legal support in addressing wrongful convictions. His story highlights the urgent need for systemic reforms to prevent similar injustices in the future.",

The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million.

Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff. The only thing holding the GMC Yukon and its terrified driver from a 30-foot drop was a crumpled chain-link fence, still clinging to the earth above Bryden Canyon Road. \"I seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and I was like 'Oh man,' 'cause only like five links were hanging there,\" Warnock told KXLY, a CNN affiliate. \"I was like, I gotta do something and no one was doing anything.\" What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, 'Are you alright man?' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn't break. Every time I hit it, the thing rocked like it was going to fall off,\" Warnock told KXLY. Sitko was finally able to get the passenger-side window down. Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough's camera. Then Warnock disappeared. \"I left and got out of there before anyone knew who I was,\" he said. He remained an unknown good Samaritan, his identity a mystery, until Kough's picture of the daring rescue appeared in the Lewiston paper and spread across the Internet. \"I don't feel like I deserve any credit or anything,\" Warnock said. \"I just did what anyone would do, went right back to work.\" Thanks to Warnock, Sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries. \"The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening,\" said Roger Lanier, the interim police chief. Warnock told KXLY he didn't want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself.",

    "dense_summary": "In a dramatic rescue that captured international attention, Jason Warnock became an unexpected hero in Lewiston, Idaho, when he saved a young driver from a potentially fatal accident. The incident unfolded on a routine Wednesday as Warnock drove through a canyon and noticed a fallen tree blocking the road. His attention was soon drawn to a more alarming sight: an SUV, specifically a GMC Yukon, precariously teetering over the edge of a cliff, held back only by a severely damaged chain-link fence.\n\nThe driver, identified as 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, was trapped inside the vehicle, visibly in shock and attempting to break free. Warnock, realizing the urgency of the situation, sprang into action while others around him remained inactive. He quickly assessed the precarious scene, noting that only a few links of the fence were preventing the SUV from plummeting 30 feet down Bryden Canyon Road.\n\nArmed with a Snap-on multi-tool, Warnock attempted to break the vehicle's window. Despite his efforts, the window resisted, and each strike caused the SUV to sway dangerously, heightening the risk of it falling. Meanwhile, Sitko managed to lower the passenger-side window, allowing Warnock to reach in and pull him to safety. This heroic moment was captured by Barry Kough, a photographer for the Lewiston Tribune, whose images soon went viral.\n\nRemarkably, after the rescue, Warnock quietly left the scene, avoiding any immediate recognition or accolades. His identity remained a mystery until Kough's photograph was published, revealing the face of the good Samaritan who had acted so decisively and bravely. Despite the widespread attention and praise, Warnock remained humble, expressing that he simply did what anyone else would have done in the same situation. He stated his preference for a quiet life, mentioning he would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about his heroics in the news.\n\nThe Lewiston Police Department publicly acknowledged Warnock's courageous actions, with interim police chief Roger Lanier commending him for his quick thinking and intervention, which prevented further harm to Sitko. Thanks to Warnock's timely intervention, Sitko emerged from the incident with only minor injuries and was treated at a local hospital.\n\nWarnock's story is a testament to the power of quick thinking and selflessness in emergency situations. His actions not only saved a life but also inspired many, illustrating how ordinary citizens can become extraordinary heroes when faced with unexpected challenges. Despite his reluctance to embrace the spotlight, Warnock's bravery and humility have left a lasting impact, resonating with people around the world.",

    "article": "(CNN)The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word \"genocide\" did not exist at the time. The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts. Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war. In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations. So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers: . The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports. Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan. By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated. April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day. This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922. Almost any way one can imagine. While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt. The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported. In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\" No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime. The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing. Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings. Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word. Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences.\" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word \"genocide,\" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians.",

    "dense_summary": "The article discusses the contentious historical issue of the Armenian mass killings by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, which many scholars and nations recognize as the first genocide of the 20th century. Despite the term \"genocide\" being coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin to describe the Holocaust, the events from 1915 to 1923 have been retrospectively categorized under this term by several countries and historians.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, aligned with Germany and Austria-Hungary during World War I, feared that Armenians within its borders would support Russia, a long-time adversary with ambitions over Constantinople. This led to Armenians being portrayed as a national threat. On April 23-24, 1915, Ottoman authorities in Constantinople arrested approximately 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders, many of whom were subsequently deported or killed. This event, known as Red Sunday, marks the beginning of the Armenian Genocide and is commemorated annually by Armenians worldwide.\n\nThe death toll from the genocide is heavily disputed, with estimates ranging from 300,000 to 2 million. Ottoman records suggest about 800,000 Armenians died between 1915 and 1918, yet most scholarly estimates place the figure between 600,000 and 1.5 million. The Armenian population in Turkey plummeted from 2 million in 1914 to less than 400,000 by 1922, due to killings and forced deportations.\n\nThe methods of killing were brutal and varied, including mass burnings, drownings, torture, and starvation. Reports also describe children being thrown overboard at sea and widespread sexual violence. Many Armenians were forcibly relocated to Syria and left to die in the desert.\n\nInternational recognition of the genocide remains a deeply divisive issue. Countries like Armenia, France, Russia, and Canada recognize the events as genocide. Germany was expected to join this list on the 100th anniversary of the killings. However, Turkey, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission do not officially label the events as genocide. In 1985, a U.N. subcommittee recognized the genocide, but subsequent U.N. leaders, including Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, have refrained from using the term.\n\nIn 2014, then-Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan extended condolences to the descendants of the victims, acknowledging the \"inhumane consequences\" of the events. This was a significant gesture, as it marked the first time a Turkish leader publicly recognized Armenian suffering, although Turkey continues to reject the classification of the events as genocide.\n\nThe debate over terminology is not just about historical accuracy but also involves issues of national identity and potential reparations. Armenians view recognition as essential for acknowledging their historical suffering, while Turks are concerned about the implications of admitting to genocide. The article highlights the ongoing struggle for historical acknowledgment and the complex interplay of politics, identity, and memory in this century-old tragedy.",
